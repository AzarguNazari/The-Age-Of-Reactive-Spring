# The-Age-Of-Reactive-Spring

## Reactive Web Socket (RSocket)
RSocket is a new messaging protocol that’s designed to solve some common microservice communication challenges. With RSocket you get a flexible protocol that works over TCP or WebSockets. This means you can do binary messages without conversion. You get modern controls like multiplexing, back-pressure, resumption, and routing, and you get multiple messaging modes including fire-and-forget, request-response, and streaming. RSocket is fully reactive too, so it’s ideal for your high-throughput microservice applications. Early adopters include Netflix, Pivotal, Alibaba, and Facebook—all of them experts in delivering scalable Internet-based services.
